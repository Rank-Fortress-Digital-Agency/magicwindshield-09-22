                            What To Do If Your Windshield Cracks While Driving
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            If you're driving while your windshield cracks, staying calm is essential. Pull over to a safe area, turn on your hazard lights, and call for help. You may want to temporarily cover the crack with clear tape or a piece of cardboard to prevent further damage.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If the crack is small, you may be able to repair it with a DIY kit. These kits typically come with a resin that you can inject into the gap to fill it and prevent it from spreading. If you choose to do this, follow the instructions carefully, as improper use can worsen the damage. This is only a temporary fix, and the crack will still need to be professionally repaired.

                <p>
                    If you get a large windshield crack while driving, you must immediately pull over and call for help. Driving with a cracked windshield is dangerous, as the glass could shatter and cause severe injury. Once in a safe area, turn on your hazard lights and call a tow truck or roadside assistance to take your car to a nearby repair shop.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Depending on the crack's size, the windshield will need to be replaced entirely at the repair shop. This is more costly and time-consuming than repairing minor damage, but it's crucial to ensure your safety on the road.

                            Auto glass technicians determine whether a windshield needs to be repaired or replaced based on the crack's size, depth, and location. If the damage is in your line of sight or is over three inches, the windshield will need to be replaced.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If your windshield needs to be replaced, the technician will remove the old windshield and install a new one. The process usually takes about an hour, and you'll be able to drive your car as soon as the new windshield is installed.
